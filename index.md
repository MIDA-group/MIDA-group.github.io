# About us

The MIDA group focuses on development of general methods for image data analysis. Our aim is to devise generally applicable methods, which work well independent of the particular application and types of images used. We therefore strive for robust methods which are performing well under varying conditions. 
Also aiming for practically useful methods, we essentially always collaborate with other groups towards solving real world problems, most often in the directions of healthcare and life science applications.
