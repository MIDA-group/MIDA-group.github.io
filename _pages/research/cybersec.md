## Social Cybersecurity


Most of the existing computational work on **online disinformation** focuses on a single platform. However, we can expect organised disinformation campaigns and other misinformation spreading processes to happen across platforms. The importance of the content that is spread and the existence of interconnected platforms make online disinformation a timely and appropriate application for our work on feature-rich networks. Some aspects of our interest are: (1) the detection of coordinated behaviors, that is, groups of users or groups of social media accounts collaborating to boost spreading, (2) the role of change of platform in the dynamics of spreading, e.g., to what extent moving from one platform to another (and possibly back) allows reaching new audiences, and (3) the study of how cultural and political conditions of the Nordic countries relate to the observed disinformation processes if compared with other more studied context, e.g., the US. This research is done as part of the Nordic Observatory for Social Media and Information Disorder, of which we are the Swedish academic node.
