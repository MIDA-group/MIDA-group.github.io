## Multilayer networks

Here you find links to code and libraries developed at the Infolab to analyse multilayer networks.

The <a href=""> `R multinet` library</a> was first released on CRAN in 2017, for the main systems (mac, linux, windows). To install it, you only need an Internet connection and a recent version of `R`. You can do that by typing:

    install.packages("multinet")
    
Here you can find <a href="">documentation and source code</a>, and register bugs or feature requests. 

### Python uunet.multinet

The  <a href="">`Python uunet.multinet`</a> library is a recent porting of the `R` library, available on PyPI. To install it, you only need an Internet connection and a recent version of `Python` and `pip`. You can do that by typing:

    pip install uunet
    
Here you can find <a href="">documentation and source code</a>, and register bugs or feature requests. 

### C++ uunet

The <a href="">`C++ uunet`</a> library contains most of the code behind the `R` and `Python` libraries, in addition to other code for network and data analysis we produce at the Infolab. 

Here you can find the <a href="">source code</a>, and register bugs or feature requests. 

## Replication code

The code to replicate experiments in our papers is available from the <a href="../publications">Publications</a> page.
