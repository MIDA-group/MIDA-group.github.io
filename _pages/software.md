The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multinet/index.html"> `R multinet` library</a> was first released on CRAN in 2017 and provides functions to analyse multilayer networks. To install it, you only need an Internet connection and a recent version of `R`. You can do that by typing:

    install.packages("multinet")
    
Here you can find <a href="">documentation and source code</a> (forthcoming), and register bugs or feature requests. 

## uunet.multinet (Python)

The  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/uunet/">`Python uunet.multinet`</a> library is a recent porting of the `R multinet` library, available on PyPI. To install it, you only need an Internet connection and a recent version of `Python` and `pip`. You can do that by typing:

    pip install uunet
    
Here you can find <a href="">documentation and source code</a> (forthcoming), and register bugs or feature requests. 

## uunet (C++)

The <a href="">`C++ uunet`</a> library (forthcoming) contains most of the code behind the `R` and `Python` libraries for multilayer network analysis, in addition to other code for network and data analysis we develop at the Infolab. 

## Code for paper replicability

The code to replicate experiments in our papers is available from the <a href="../publications">Publications</a> page.
