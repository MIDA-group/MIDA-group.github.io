The <a href=""> `R multinet` library</a> provides functions to analyse multilayer networks. It was first released on CRAN in 2017, for the main systems (mac, linux, windows). To install it, you only need an Internet connection and a recent version of `R`. You can do that by typing:

    install.packages("multinet")
    
Here you can find <a href="">documentation and source code</a>, and register bugs or feature requests. 

## uunet.multinet (Python)

The  <a href="">`Python uunet.multinet`</a> library is a recent porting of the `R multinet` library, available on PyPI. To install it, you only need an Internet connection and a recent version of `Python` and `pip`. You can do that by typing:

    pip install uunet
    
Here you can find <a href="">documentation and source code</a>, and register bugs or feature requests. 

## uunet (C++)

The <a href="">`C++ uunet`</a> library contains most of the code behind the `R` and `Python` libraries for multilayer network analysis, in addition to other code for network and data analysis we produce at the Infolab. 

Here you can find the <a href="">source code</a>, and register bugs or feature requests. 

## Replication code

The code to replicate experiments in our papers is available from the <a href="../publications">Publications</a> page.
