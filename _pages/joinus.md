## Open positions

### Postdoc

We currently have no open postdoc positions

### PhD

We currently have no open PhD positions

### Internship

We currently have no open internship positions.

### Thesis projects

We currently have no open thesis projects.

<!--- At our lab we host a limited number of thesis projects. Those working on these projects become temporary members of the lab, are expected to complete the project under the agreed time constraints (typically 2.5 months for bachelors and 5 months for masters) and to actively participate in the lab activities, so that they can contribute to information sharing and knowledge development. Bachelor/Master students are expected to work full time on the project, that is, around 40 hours per week. A high degree of independence, ambition and linguistic skills (English) are necessary, as all projects are part of the research activities of the lab and are expected to contribute to it with new knowledge, algorithms, code, etc.

If you are interested, please send an email to the person responsible for the project incuding your transcript, a CV, and a short motivation. --->

## Before joining

This section collects some information about how we do research.

### Expected availability

Given the creative nature of part of our work, Infolab members are generally free to work at the times and place that best fit them, compatibly with tasks requiring presence (e.g., teaching) and regulations that may be inforced by the Department or University.

At the same time, everyone is expected to contribute to the lab, which implies being available to give feedback, sharing their current research with other members (see below), and participating in lab meetings. This should be felt as an opportunity, not as a burden - in which case it's important to have a discussion about it.

Lab members should be free to take time offline. In particular, it is not necessary to be continuously online on our Slack space. Checking the Slack at least once a day is however expected, and if one is not going to be online for a few days for different reasons (e.g., holidays) it is advised to communicate it so that others do not expect to be able to reach you.

### Research quality

While "quality" is a subjective term, and we expect lab members to reflect about this concept and adopt their own definitions of quality, we also have some guidelines to ensure that some common ground is established. In particular, we want our research to be:

1. based on appropriate methods,
1. clearly and transparently communicated,
1. developed with ethical and societal awareness, 
1. replicable, and
1. usable by others.

To achieve this, research at Infolab is organised into research activities. A research activity is anything leading to a research outcome, e.g., a published article, a grant proposal, a PhD dissertation, an undergraduate thesis or research software.

Each research activity is led by a member of the lab, who is the contact author and is responsible for the research to advance and its quality. Under normal circumstances, the contact author should be available to answer questions about the activity and its outcomes for at least two years after the outcome has been made public, even in case of a change of affiliation.

Members of the lab should feel a responsibility of getting and receiving feedback from other members. At the beginning of a new research activity, the authors should pitch the idea to the other lab members, who should be available to provide constructive feedback. Before submitting a paper or research proposal the authors are invited to share it with the other lab members, who should be available to provide constructive feedback. Getting feedback even earlier is also encouraged, although not expected.

At submission time, for all products containing experiments the code to replicate the experiments should be made available in a repository in the Infolab's git workspace, in an easy-to-execute format (witth exceptions, for example double-blind reviewing processes).

### Authorship

Each research activity must have a clear list of authors. At the Infolab we define authors as in: "each author is expected to have made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; or the creation of new software used in the work; or have drafted the work or substantively revised it; AND to have approved the submitted version (and any substantially modified version that involves the author’s contribution to the study); AND to have agreed both to be personally accountable for the author’s own contributions and to ensure that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work, even ones in which the author was not personally involved, are appropriately investigated, resolved, and the resolution documented in the literature."[^1]

### Start-up checklist

When joining the lab: 

1. Make sure you secure an accommodation well in advance, because it can be difficult to find places in Uppsala.
1. A currenty faculty member will register you to our internal system.
    * Slack (we do not normally use email for communication).
    * The lab's Git space.
    * Group storage space.
1. Follow the Twitter and Facebook accounts, if you use these social media for work.
register to our bitbucket.
