## Open positions

### Postdoc

We currently have no open postdoc positions

### PhD

We currently have no open PhD positions

### Internship

We currently have no open internship positions

### Thesis projects

We currently have no open thesis projects.

<!--- At our lab we host a limited number of thesis projects. Those working on these projects become temporary members of the lab, are expected to complete the project under the agreed time constraints (typically 2.5 months for bachelors and 5 months for masters) and to actively participate in the lab activities, so that they can contribute to information sharing and knowledge development. Bachelor/Master students are expected to work full time on the project, that is, around 40 hours per week. A high degree of independence, ambition and linguistic skills (English) are necessary, as all projects are part of the research activities of the lab and are expected to contribute to it with new knowledge, algorithms, code, etc.

If you are interested, please send an email to the person responsible for the project incuding your transcript, a CV, and a short motivation. --->

## Before joining

Some information about how we do research.

The main objective of the Infolab is to perform high quality research. While "quality" is a subjective term, and we expect lab members to reflect about this concept and adopt their own definitions of quality, we also have some guidelines to ensure that some common ground is established. In particular, we want our research to be:

1. based on appropriate methods,
1. clearly and transparently communicated,
1. replicable,
1. developed with ethical and societal awareness, and
1. usable by others.

To achieve this, research at Infolab is organised into research activities. A research activity is anything leading to a research outcome, e.g., a published article, a grant proposal, a PhD dissertation, an undergraduate thesis or research software. Research activities belong to one or more main research areas of the lab.

Each research activity must have a clear list of authors. At the InfoLab we define authors as in [1]: "each author is expected to have made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; or the creation of new software used in the work; or have drafted the work or substantively revised it; AND to have approved the submitted version (and any substantially modified version that involves the author’s contribution to the study); AND to have agreed both to be personally accountable for the author’s own contributions and to ensure that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work, even ones in which the author was not personally involved, are appropriately investigated, resolved, and the resolution documented in the literature."

Each research activity led by a member of the lab in the areas specified above should also have him/her as contact author. Under normal circumstances, the contact author should be available to answer questions about the activity and its outcomes for (at least) two years after the outcome has been made public, even in case of a change of affiliation. Members of the lab are encouraged to follow the same guidelines for their other research outcomes.

At the beginning of a new research activity, the authors should pitch the idea to the other lab members, who should be available to provide constructive feedback.

One week before submitting a paper or research proposal the authors should share it with the other lab members, who should be available to provide constructive feedback. Getting feedback even earlier is also encouraged, although not expected.

At submission time, for all products containing experiments the code to replicate the experiments should be made available in a repository in the Infolab's git workspace, in an easy-to-execute format.
