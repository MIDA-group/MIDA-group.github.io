# Readings in Network Science (PhD level)

**Period:** Spring term 2023

**Contact:** Matteo Magnani

## Description of the course

Network Science is an interdisciplinary field aimed at studying physical, social, and biological systems that can be modeled as sets of interconnected entities. 

This reading course consists of monthly meetings where we discuss research papers in the network science area, that all participants must have read in advance. At each meeting, one/two participants act as discussants for one/two papers, preparing a short introduction, questions to be discussed, and leading the discussion. More details are available in the Studium course page.

## Time plan

The dates of the meetings are the following:

 * Tue, Feb 28, 10:00-11:45
 * Tue, Mar 28, 10:00-11:45
 * Tue, Apr 25, 10:00-11:45
 * Tue, May 30, 10:00-11:45
 * Tue, Feb 28, 10:00-11:45

## Credits and assessment

Students must prepare for the meetings by reading the papers and preparing questions and reflections, actively participate in the discussions, and discuss (at least) one paper. The course corresponds to 1.5 credits, or 1 week of full-time work. While the course is open to non PhD students, *only PhD students can get credits*.

## Expected level and prerequisites

The course is targeted to PhD students and  researchers who:
 * already know the basic terminology, measures (e.g., betweenness), and models (e.g., preferential attachment); for example having attended our PhD course: _Introduction to Network Science_, or
 * attend our _Short Introduction to Network Science_ on Tue, Feb 7, 09:00-15:30.

## Registration

The course is free for PhD students and researchers, but the number of available places is limited, to allow everyone to actively participate in the discussions; PhD students at Uppsala University will be given first priority, and researchers (postdoc & Faculty) at Uppsala University will be given second priority.

Please *[apply to the course](https://doit.medfarm.uu.se/bin/kurt3/kurt/81664) latest January 19, 2023*. If you register later you may still be admitted, but you may not get a chance to propose papers of your interest (in any case, there is no guarantee that papers you propose will be selected for discussion).
