## Courses at Uppsala University

At Uppsala University, courses given by members of the lab that are particularly relevant are:
* The Bachelor-level [Introduction to computational social science](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1DLxxx)
* The Master-level [Data Mining I](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1DL360) and [Data Mining](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1DL370)
* The PhD-level [Network Science](../netsciphd/netsciphd2020) and [Readings in Network Science](../netsciphd/netscireadings2018).
Normally, students willing to work on a master thesis at the lab are required to have taken a Data Mining course, and PhD students must take the Network Science and the Readings in Network Science courses. 

We also regularly give courses and tutorials at other international venues. Past venues include the ESSLLI school and the SunBelt, IC2S2, Asonam, ICWSM, SocInfo and ARS conferences.
