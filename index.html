<h2>About us</h2>

<div>
At the Uppsala University Information Laboratory (UU-Infolab) we do basic and applied research on
the extraction of knowledge from social data. We develop models, methods, methodologies, and
software to analyse multilayer, temporal, textual, visual, and probabilistic information networks,
that we use to capture complex aspects of contemporary social data, such as heterogenity, velocity,
unstructuredness, and uncertainty.
Our applications include the analysis of online political communication and the study of online
disinformation.
