<h2>Hello world!</h2>

At the Uppsala University Information Laboratory (UU-InfoLab) we do basic and applied research on the extraction of knowledge from data. We develop models, methods, and software combining multilayer networks, temporal and textual information, and imperfect data. Applications include the analysis of online political data and the study of online disinformation.
